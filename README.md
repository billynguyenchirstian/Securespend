The first step towards securing spend is to have a well-defined strategy in place. This involves analyzing your current spending patterns, identifying areas of improvement, and setting clear goals for your spend management. Here are some key strategies that can help you achieve this:

### 1\. Create a Budget and Stick to It

Having a budget in place is crucial for effective spend management. A budget outlines how much money you can allocate towards different expenses and helps you prioritize your spending. By setting a realistic budget and sticking to it, you can avoid overspending and keep your finances under control. It also allows for better forecasting and planning for future expenditures.

To create a budget, start by analyzing your previous spending patterns and identifying areas where you can cut costs. Make sure to involve key stakeholders in this process to get a comprehensive view of your organization's spending needs. Once you have a budget in place, regularly review and adjust it as needed to reflect any changes in your business.

### 2\. Implement Spend Controls

Spend controls are policies and procedures put in place to monitor and control spending within an organization. These controls can help prevent unauthorized purchases and reduce the risk of fraud and misuse of funds. Some common spend controls include:

*   Approval processes for purchases above a certain amount
*   Restricted access to company credit cards or expense accounts
*   Monthly or quarterly spending reviews

By implementing these controls, you can ensure that all expenditures are in line with your budget and aligned with your organization's goals.

### 3\. Leverage Technology

Technology plays a critical role in modern-day spend management. With the rise of digital payments and online transactions, manual processes are becoming less reliable and more prone to errors. Investing in a robust spend management system can help streamline your processes and provide better visibility into your spending.

There are various software solutions available that can automate spend control procedures, track expenses, and generate reports for analysis. These tools can also integrate with your accounting software, making it easier to keep track of your financials. Additionally, they can flag any suspicious activities or discrepancies, providing an extra layer of security for your spend management.

Data analytics has become a critical component of modern-day business operations, and it plays an equally important role in securing spend. By leveraging data analytics, organizations can gain insights into their spending patterns, identify areas of improvement, and detect any suspicious activities. Let's explore some key ways data analytics can help secure spend:

### 1\. Identifying Anomalies and Fraudulent Activities

By analyzing large volumes of data, data analytics can help identify patterns and detect any anomalies or fraudulent activities. This can include duplicate or unauthorized purchases, inflated invoices, or suspicious transactions. This early detection can help prevent any potential financial losses and safeguard an organization's reputation.

### 2\. Forecasting and Planning

Data analytics can provide valuable insights into an organization's spend patterns, allowing for better forecasting and planning. By analyzing historical data, businesses can make informed decisions on future investments, budget allocations, and resource management. This not only helps optimize spending but also ensures financial stability.

### 3\. Supplier Performance Monitoring

In addition to monitoring internal spend, data analytics can also be used to track and monitor supplier performance. By analyzing data from past transactions, organizations can identify vendors who consistently provide high-quality products or services at competitive prices. This can help build stronger relationships with suppliers and ultimately lead to cost savings.

Addressing Fraud and Abuse in Spend Management
----------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, fraud and abuse of funds are common in the business world, and it is essential to have measures in place to address these issues. Here are some key ways organizations can prevent and address fraud and abuse in their spend management processes:

### 1\. Conduct Regular Audits

Regular audits are crucial for detecting any potential fraud or misuse of funds. These audits should involve a thorough review of all financial transactions and should be conducted by an independent party. The results of these audits can help identify any discrepancies and take corrective actions.

### 2\. Implement Segregation of Duties

Segregation of duties involves dividing responsibilities among different individuals to prevent any one person from having too much control over financial transactions. This helps reduce the risk of fraudulent activities as multiple people are involved in the process and can keep a check on each other.

### 3\. Invest in Fraud Detection Technology

As technology continues to advance, so do fraud detection techniques. Organizations can invest in specialized software that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect anomalies and flag suspicious activities. These tools can continuously monitor financial transactions and provide real-time alerts in case of any potential fraud.

Building a Culture of Spend Responsibility
------------------------------------------

While implementing secure spend processes and leveraging technology is crucial, building a culture of spend responsibility is equally important. This involves educating and empowering employees to make informed decisions when it comes to spending. Here are some key ways organizations can foster a culture of spend responsibility:

### 1\. Promote Transparency and Communication

Transparency and communication are essential for building trust within an organization. By promoting an open-door policy, employees feel comfortable raising any concerns or questions they may have regarding financial transactions. This can help catch any potential issues early on and prevent them from escalating.

### 2\. Reward Responsible Spending

Recognizing and rewarding employees who consistently adhere to spend management protocols can help reinforce a culture of financial responsibility. This can be in the form of bonuses, promotions, or other incentives. By doing so, organizations can encourage their employees to be more mindful of their spending habits.

### 3\. Provide Regular Training

As mentioned earlier, regular training is crucial for educating employees on spend management procedures. Organizations should also provide ongoing training to keep employees informed about any changes or updates to these processes. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and follows the same guidelines.

The Future of Secure Spend: Emerging Trends and Innovation
----------------------------------------------------------

The world of finance is constantly evolving, and the same goes for secure spend management. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see new trends and innovations emerge in this space. Here are some key areas to watch out for in the future:

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are already being used in fraud detection and prevention. As these technologies continue to advance, we can expect to see more sophisticated tools that can analyze and detect fraudulent activities in real-time. This can greatly enhance the security of spend management processes.

### 2\. Predictive Analytics

Predictive analytics involves analyzing past data to forecast future outcomes, and it has numerous applications in the world of finance. In terms of secure spend management, predictive analytics can help organizations anticipate potential risks and take proactive measures to prevent them. This can greatly reduce the impact of any potential financial losses.

### 3\. Blockchain Technology

As mentioned earlier, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize secure spend management. As this technology becomes more mainstream, we can expect to see more businesses adopting it for their financial transactions. This can enhance security and transparency in financial processes, making them less prone to fraud and abuse.

Measuring the Impact of Secure Spend Strategies
-----------------------------------------------

The effectiveness of any strategy or process can only be measured by tracking its impact. The same goes for secure spend strategies. Organizations should regularly monitor and measure the impact of these strategies to ensure they are achieving their intended results.

### Installation:

    git clone git@github.com:salsita/chrome-extension-skeleton.git

    # in case you don't have webpack yet:
    sudo npm install -g webpack

### Build instructions:

To install dependencies:

    cd chrome-extension-skeleton
    npm install

Then to start a developing session (with watch), run:

    npm start

To start a unit testing session (with watch):

    npm test

To check code for linting errors:

    npm run lint


To build production code + crx:

    npm run build

To run unit tests in CI scripts:

    npm run test:ci


### Directory structure:

    /build             # this is where your extension (.crx) will end up,
                       # along with unpacked directories of production and
                       # develop build (for debugging)

    /src
        /css           # CSS files
        /html          # HTML files
        /images        # image resources

        /js            # entry-points for browserify, requiring node.js `modules`

            /libs      # 3rd party run-time libraries, excluded from JS-linting
            /modules   # node.js modules (and corresponding mocha
                       #   unit tests spec files)

        manifest.json  # skeleton manifest file, `name`, `description`
                       #   and `version` fields copied from `package.json`       

    /webpack           # webpack configuration files

    .babelrc           # Babel configuration
    .eslintrc          # options for JS-linting
    circle.yml         # integration with CircleCI
    mykey.pem          # certificate file, YOU NEED TO GENERATE THIS FILE, see below
    package.json       # project description file (name, version, dependencies, ...)


### After you clone:

1. In `package.json`, rename the project, description, version, add dependencies
and any other fields necessary.

2. Generate your .pem key and store it in the root as `mykey.pem` file. On
unix / mac, the command to generate the file is
`openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt > mykey.pem`.
Note: the generated file is in `.gitignore` file, it won't be (and should NOT
be) commited to the repository unless you know what you are doing.

3. Add content (HTML, CSS, images, JS modules), update `code/manifest.json`,
leave only JS entry-points you use (remove the ones you don't need).

4. When developing, write unit-tests, use `npm test` to check that
your code passes unit-tests and `npm run lint` to check for linting errors.

5. When ready to try out the extension in the browser, use `npm start` to
build it. In `build` directory you'll find develop version of the extension in
`dev` subdirectory (with source maps), and production (uglified)
version in `prod` directory. The `.crx` packed version is created from
`prod` sources.

6. When done developing, publish the extension and enjoy it (profit!).

Use any 3rd party libraries you need (both for run-time and for development /
testing), use regular npm node.js modules (that will be installed into
`node_modules` directory). These libraries will be encapsulated in the resulting
code and will NOT conflict even with libraries on pages where you inject the
resulting JS scripts to (for content scripts).

For more information, please check also README.md files in subdirectories.
